Relationships dataset contains anonymized records of students\u2019 social\u2010media behaviors and related life outcomes. It spans multiple countries and academic levels, focusing on key dimensions such as usage intensity, platform preferences, and relationship dynamics. Each row represents one student\u2019s survey response, offering a cross\u2010sectional snapshot suitable for statistical analysis and machine\u2010learning applications.\n\n### Scope \u0026 Coverage\n**Population:**Students aged 16\u201325 enrolled in high school, undergraduate, or graduate programs.\n\n**Geography**: Multi\u2010country coverage (e.g., Bangladesh, India, USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Japan, South Korea).\n\n**Timeframe**: Data collected via a one\u2010time online survey administered in Q1 2025.\n\n**Volume:** Configurable sample sizes (e.g., 100, 500, 1,000 records) based on research needs.\n\n### Data Collection \u0026 Methodology\n\n**Survey Design:** Questions adapted from validated scales on social\u2010media addiction (e.g., Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale) and relationship conflict indices.\n\n**Recruitment:** Participants recruited through university mailing lists and social\u2010media platforms, ensuring diversity in academic level and country.\n\n### Data Quality Controls:\n\n**Validation:** Mandatory fields and range checks (e.g., usage hours between 0\u201324).\n\n**De\u2010duplication:** Removal of duplicate entries via unique Student_ID checks.\n\n**Anonymization:** No personally identifiable information collected.\n### Key Variables\n| Variable                       | Type        | Description                                                |\n| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| \u0060Student_ID\u0060                   | Integer     | Unique respondent identifier                               |\n| \u0060Age\u0060                          | Integer     | Age in years                                               |\n| \u0060Gender\u0060                       | Categorical | Male or Female                                             |\n| \u0060Academic_Level\u0060               | Categorical | High School / Undergraduate / Graduate                     |\n| \u0060Country\u0060                      | Categorical | Country of residence                                       |\n| \u0060Avg_Daily_Usage_Hours\u0060        | Float       | Average hours per day spent on social media                |\n| \u0060Most_Used_Platform\u0060           | Categorical | Primary platform used (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc.)  |\n| \u0060Affects_Academic_Performance\u0060 | Boolean     | Self-reported impact of social media on academics (Yes/No) |\n| \u0060Sleep_Hours_Per_Night\u0060        | Float       | Average number of sleep hours per night                    |\n| \u0060Mental_Health_Score\u0060          | Integer     | Self-rated mental health score (1 = Poor, 10 = Excellent)  |\n| \u0060Relationship_Status\u0060          | Categorical | Single / In Relationship / Complicated                     |\n| \u0060Conflicts_Over_Social_Media\u0060  | Integer     | Number of relationship conflicts caused by social media    |\n| \u0060Addicted_Score\u0060               | Integer     | Social media addiction score (1 = Low, 10 = High)          |\n\n### Potential Analyses\n**Correlation Studies:** Examine associations between daily usage hours and mental\u2010health score or sleep hours.\n\n**Predictive Modeling:** Build classifiers to predict relationship conflicts based on usage patterns and platform type.\n\n**Clustering:** Identify user segments (e.g., \u201Chigh\u2010usage high\u2010stress\u201D vs. \u201Cmoderate\u2010usage balanced\u201D) across countries.\n### Limitations\n**Self\u2010Report Bias** : All measures are self\u2010reported and may be subject to social\u2010desirability effects.\n\n**Cross\u2010Sectional Design** : One\u2010time survey prevents causal inference.\n\n**Sampling Variability** : Recruitment via online channels may underrepresent students with limited internet access.\n\n### Attribution\nThis dataset is redistributed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.\n\nOriginal source: Kaggle dataset uploaded under CC BY 4.0.
